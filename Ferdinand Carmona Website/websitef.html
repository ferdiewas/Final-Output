                <h2>Ferdinand Carmona</h2>
                <p>My name is Ferdinand Labay Carmona. 
                    I was called by so many name When I go to some place I have different nicknames, 
                    when I am at the House they called me “Victor” they called me Victor
                     because when I am little I usually say that name because that’s my grandfather name and they give that nickname. 
                     And when my Grandmother miss my grandfather she will call to hug and kiss and she will say that you’re like your grandfather and 
                     then she will give me money to buy foods. When I hear someone calling me victor they are relatives from my father side. 
                     When I am with my grandparents in my mother side they called me “Mage”. They called me mage because of my first name they get that with Ferdinand Magellan
                     they get the four letter of Ferdinand Magellan last name. When I’m at school they have another nickname for me but this is not in the Adamson this is when 
                     I was a elementary to senior high school they called me “Ferds sometimes perdo ” even my friends in my province.
                     But here in our University they called me “ferd or ferdie”. I lived in Malate,Manila but the place where I grew up is the Province of Mindoro also known at the place of the Tamaraw. 
                     City of Pinamalayan, Baranggay Cacawan. I was born on December 10,2003 and my birth place is in Pinamalayan community hospital. 
                     My mother name is Evelyn Labay Carmona and my father name is Rodelino Musnit Carmona. The school where I graduated my preschool up to is JMSMPS or Juan Morente Sr. Memorial Pilot School and 
                     I think JMSMPS is the biggest elementary school in our province. And High School to Senior High School is ABADA COLLEGE. 
                     The memorable experience when I was on my elementary days. We usually go here in manila because my father has always an check-up in USTH.
                     And these memories I will not forget because this is the first time we travel even it is near we just go to Tagaytay. 
                     The memorable experiences in my adolescent is when meet my friends in my provinces because they perfect friends no left behind 
                     it was so solid we like to travel go to the beaches camping  there overnight we like giving and listening in our story. 
                     In the Picture that’s not my mother that’s one who is taking care of me when my parents is at work.</p>
